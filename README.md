1. Private ips

Find and display all private ips contained in the ips file in the private_ips folder

2. Hello world

We would love to deploy our brand new hello world app in our kubernetes cluster
In order to do that, please create all the needed terraform ressources in the terraform folder.

For this exercise, we will use:
* This docker image: [Hello World](https://hub.docker.com/r/strm/helloworld-http/)
* The container uses the port 80
* Use `hello-word.ecov.io` DNS to expose our app to the world.
